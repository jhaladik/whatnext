● The Intelligent Question Analyzer: Beyond Static Surveys

  1. The Core Insight

  Questions aren't just data collection - they're a conversation. The perfect system would understand:
  - What you answer
  - How fast you answer (confidence)
  - What you skip (avoidance)
  - How you change answers (uncertainty)
  - When you quit (frustration point)

  2. Multi-Dimensional Question Intelligence

  class QuestionIntelligence {

    // LEVEL 1: Response Velocity Analysis
    analyzeResponseVelocity(responseTime, questionComplexity) {
      /*
      Fast + Simple = Certain/Bored
      Fast + Complex = Expert/Passionate
      Slow + Simple = Uncertain/Distracted
      Slow + Complex = Thoughtful/Engaged
      */
    }

    // LEVEL 2: Micro-Hesitation Detection
    detectMicroPatterns(clickStream) {
      /*
      - Hover patterns over options
      - Option changes before submit
      - Scroll behavior during question
      - Time gaps (did they leave and return?)
      - Mouse/finger movement patterns
      */
    }

    // LEVEL 3: Contradiction Detection
    findCognitiveDissonance(answers) {
      /*
      User says "want something light" but picks "full focus"
      Says "adventurous" but chooses "familiar"
      → These contradictions reveal deeper needs
      */
    }

    // LEVEL 4: Emotional Trajectory Mapping
    mapEmotionalJourney(sessionData) {
      /*
      Question 1: Excited (fast response)
      Question 2: Engaged (moderate)
      Question 3: Frustrated (slow)
      Question 4: Skipped
      → System learns optimal question count
      */
    }
  }

  3. The Adaptive Question Tree

  Instead of linear questions, imagine a dynamic decision tree:

  // Traditional: Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → Q4 → Q5 → Results

  // Intelligent Tree:
  //          Start
  //            ↓
  //    [Mood Check - 2 seconds]
  //      ↙         ↘
  //  Happy          Sad
  //    ↓             ↓
  // [Energy?]    [Comfort?]
  //    ↓             ↓
  // (Skip 2 Qs)  [Deeper Q]
  //    ↓             ↓
  //  Results     Results

  4. Question Generation Evolution

  Generation 1: Static Questions
  - "What's your mood?"
  - Fixed options: Happy/Sad/Neutral

  Generation 2: Contextual Questions
  - "It's Friday night - looking to unwind or amp up?"
  - Time-aware options

  Generation 3: Personalized Questions
  - "Last time you loved Inception - ready for another mind-bender?"
  - History-aware

  Generation 4: Predictive Questions
  - "I'm sensing you want something darker than usual - am I right?"
  - Pattern-aware

  Generation 5: Emergent Questions
  - System creates NEW questions based on user patterns
  - "Would you watch something your ex would hate?" (revenge viewing pattern detected)

  5. The Micro-Signal Orchestra

  class MicroSignalDetector {

    signals = {
      // Speed signals
      blazingFast: < 500ms,      // Muscle memory, not thinking
      confident: 500-1500ms,      // Sure of answer
      considering: 1500-3000ms,   // Weighing options
      uncertain: 3000-5000ms,     // Unsure
      distracted: > 5000ms,       // Multitasking

      // Pattern signals
      straightShooter: 'Answers in order without revisiting',
      optimizer: 'Changes answers multiple times',
      skipper: 'Avoids certain question types',
      speedRunner: 'Rushes through everything',
      contemplator: 'Consistent thoughtful pace',

      // Interaction signals
      optionHoverer: 'Mouses over options before choosing',
      scrollReturner: 'Scrolls down then back up',
      tabSwitcher: 'Leaves and returns (checking other sites?)',
      mobileThumber: 'One-handed vs two-handed interaction',
    };

    // Combine signals for insights
    interpretSignals(signals) {
      if (signals.blazingFast && signals.straightShooter) {
        return 'POWER_USER'; // Knows exactly what they want
      }
      if (signals.uncertain && signals.optionHoverer) {
        return 'NEEDS_GUIDANCE'; // Wants help deciding
      }
      if (signals.speedRunner && signals.skipper) {
        return 'IMPATIENT'; // Just give me something!
      }
    }
  }

  6. Psychological Question Techniques

  The Paradox Question:
  - "Would you rather watch something that makes you think or helps you not think?"
  - Forces cognitive resolution

  The Projection Question:
  - "What would your best friend recommend to you right now?"
  - Bypasses self-censorship

  The Constraint Question:
  - "If you only had 30 minutes, what matters most?"
  - Reveals true priorities

  The Metaphor Question:
  - "Is your mood more thunderstorm or light rain?"
  - Accesses emotional state indirectly

  The Regression Question:
  - "What did 15-year-old you love to watch?"
  - Taps into core preferences

  The Counterfactual Question:
  - "What do you never want to watch again?"
  - Defines boundaries clearly

  7. Question Effectiveness Scoring

  class QuestionEffectivenessAnalyzer {

    scoreQuestion(questionId, analytics) {
      const metrics = {
        // Predictive Power
        correlationWithSatisfaction: 0.85,    // How well does it predict happiness?
        informationGain: 0.72,                // How much does it narrow choices?

        // User Experience
        avgResponseTime: 2.3,                 // Seconds (faster = clearer)
        skipRate: 0.05,                       // 5% skip (lower = engaging)
        frustrationSignals: 0.02,             // Back button, refreshes

        // Differentiation Power
        answerDistribution: [0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2], // Even = good discrimination
        crossUserVariance: 0.65,              // Different users answer differently

        // Temporal Stability
        consistencyOverTime: 0.80,            // Same user answers similarly
        contextSensitivity: 0.30,             // Changes with context appropriately
      };

      return this.calculateCompositeScore(metrics);
    }

    // Questions that are failing
    identifyProblematicQuestions() {
      return {
        "genre_preference": {
          issue: "Too broad - everyone says 'all genres'",
          suggestion: "Ask about specific genre combinations instead"
        },
        "movie_length": {
          issue: "Poor predictor - people's actual choice varies",
          suggestion: "Infer from attention_level instead"
        }
      };
    }
  }

  8. Cultural & Contextual Intelligence

  class CulturalQuestionAdapter {

    adaptQuestionForCulture(question, userContext) {
      const { country, language, timezone, culturalEvents } = userContext;

      // Example: Diwali in India
      if (country === 'IN' && isNearDiwali()) {
        return {
          text: "Festive family gathering or solo celebration?",
          options: [
            "Family-friendly blockbuster",
            "Cultural classic",
            "Modern celebration",
            "My own vibe"
          ]
        };
      }

      // Example: Sunday Scaries in USA
      if (country === 'US' && isSundayEvening()) {
        return {
          text: "Tomorrow's Monday - escape or prepare?",
          options: [
            "Full escape mode",
            "Gentle motivation",
            "Productive procrastination",
            "Embrace the dread"
          ]
        };
      }
    }
  }

  9. The Learning Loop

  class QuestionLearningSystem {

    async evolveQuestions() {
      // 1. Collect all pathways that led to high satisfaction
      const successPaths = await this.getHighSatisfactionJourneys();

      // 2. Identify common patterns
      const patterns = this.extractPatterns(successPaths);

      // 3. Generate hypothesis for new questions
      const newQuestionHypotheses = this.generateQuestionIdeas(patterns);

      // 4. A/B test new questions
      const experiments = this.createExperiments(newQuestionHypotheses);

      // 5. Measure and iterate
      const results = await this.runExperiments(experiments);

      // 6. Promote winners, kill losers
      this.updateQuestionBank(results);
    }

    // Example of emergent question discovery
    discoverEmergentQuestion() {
      /*
      Pattern noticed: Users who choose "energetic" + "escape" + "surprise"
      often refinement to "darker"

      New Question Generated: "Light adventure or dark journey?"
      This captures the pattern in one question instead of three
      */
    }
  }

  10. The Meta-Question System

  Questions about questions:

  class MetaQuestionSystem {

    // Ask users to rate the questions themselves
    async collectMetaFeedback(sessionId) {
      return {
        "Which question was hardest to answer?",
        "Which question was most helpful?",
        "What question do you wish we had asked?",
        "How many questions feel right? (current: 5)"
      };
    }

    // Learn what questions users WANT to be asked
    async analyzeWishlistQuestions() {
      /*
      Users keep saying they wish we asked about:
      - "Am I watching alone or with someone?"
      - "Do I want to feel the same or different after?"
      - "Should I be able to talk about this tomorrow?"
      */
    }
  }

  11. The Ultimate Goal: Zero Questions

  The perfect system would eventually need NO questions:

  class PredictiveQuestionSystem {

    async generateRecommendations(userId, context) {
      // Step 1: Predict all answers
      const predictedAnswers = await this.predictAnswers(userId, context);

      // Step 2: Calculate confidence
      const confidence = this.calculateConfidence(predictedAnswers);

      if (confidence > 0.85) {
        // Skip questions entirely
        return this.getRecommendations(predictedAnswers);
      } else {
        // Only ask questions we're uncertain about
        const uncertainQuestions = this.getUncertainQuestions(predictedAnswers);
        return this.askOnly(uncertainQuestions);
      }
    }
  }

  12. Breakthrough Ideas

  The Mood Gradient Slider:
  Instead of discrete options, a visual gradient users can tap on

  The Speed Date Questions:
  10 questions, 1 second each, gut reactions only

  The Anti-Question:
  Show 4 movie posters, user picks what they DON'T want

  The Comparison Question:
  "More like Friday or more like Monday?" (abstract associations)

  The Completion Question:
  "Tonight I want to feel ____" (free text, NLP analysis)

  The Visual Journey:
  Select images that represent your mood (no words)

  The Time Travel Question:
  "Where do you want to be in 2 hours?" (end state focus)

  This question system would be constantly learning, evolving, and improving. Each user interaction teaches it how to ask     
   better questions for the next user.

  Want to explore any of these concepts deeper? We could:
  1. Design the A/B testing framework for questions
  2. Build the micro-signal detection system
  3. Create the question evolution algorithm
  4. Implement the predictive question system
  5. Design the visual/interactive question formats
