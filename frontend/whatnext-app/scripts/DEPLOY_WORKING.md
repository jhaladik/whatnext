● Production Deployment Complete! 🎉

  Your WhatNext frontend is now properly deployed to production on the main branch:

  Live URLs:

  - Production (main): https://whatnext-frontend.pages.dev
  - Latest Deploy: https://21f9b11b.whatnext-frontend.pages.dev

  What's been set up:

  1. ✅ Created main branch and pushed to GitHub
  2. ✅ Deployed to Cloudflare Pages with main as production
  3. ✅ Updated all deployment scripts to use main branch
  4. ✅ Fixed session persistence between pages

  To deploy future updates:

  # Make sure you're on main branch
  git checkout main

  # Deploy to production
  npm run deploy:production

  # Or use the script
  .\deploy-production.ps1

  Your app is now live in production! The main branch deployments will automatically appear as "Production" in your
  Cloudflare Pages dashboard.
